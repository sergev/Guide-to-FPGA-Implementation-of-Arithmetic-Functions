*
* The Xilinx timer/counter component. This component supports the Xilinx
* timer/counter. More detailed description of the driver operation can
* be found in the xtmrctr.c file.
*
* The Xilinx timer/counter supports the following features:
*   - Polled mode.
*   - Interrupt driven mode
*   - enabling and disabling specific timers
*   - PWM operation
*
* The driver does not currently support the PWM operation of the device.
*
* The timer counter operates in 2 primary modes, compare and capture. In
* either mode, the timer counter may count up or down, with up being the
* default.
*
* Compare mode is typically used for creating a single time period or multiple
* repeating time periods in the auto reload mode, such as a periodic interrupt.
* When started, the timer counter loads an initial value, referred to as the
* compare value, into the timer counter and starts counting down or up. The
* timer counter expires when it rolls over/under depending upon the mode of
* counting. An external compare output signal may be configured such that a
* pulse is generated with this signal when it hits the compare value.
*
* Capture mode is typically used for measuring the time period between
* external events. This mode uses an external capture input signal to cause
* the value of the timer counter to be captured. When started, the timer
* counter loads an initial value, referred to as the compare value,

* The timer can be configured to either cause an interrupt when the count
* reaches the compare value in compare mode or latch the current count
* value in the capture register when an external input is asserted
* in capture mode. The external capture input can be enabled/disabled using the
* XTmrCtr_SetOptions function. While in compare mode, it is also possible to
* drive an external output when the compare value is reached in the count
* register The external compare output can be enabled/disabled using the
* XTmrCtr_SetOptions function.
*
* <b>Interrupts</b>
*
* It is the responsibility of the application to connect the interrupt
* handler of the timer/counter to the interrupt source. The interrupt
* handler function, XTmrCtr_InterruptHandler, is visible such that the user
* can connect it to the interrupt source. Note that this interrupt handler
* does not provide interrupt context save and restore processing, the user
* must perform this processing.
*
* The driver services interrupts and passes timeouts to the upper layer
* software through callback functions. The upper layer software must register
* its callback functions during initialization. The driver requires callback
* functions for timers.
*
* @note
* The default settings for the timers are:
*   - Interrupt generation disabled
*   - Count up mode
*   - Compare mode
*   - Hold counter (will not reload the timer)
*   - External compare output disabled
*   - External capture input disabled
*   - Pulse width modulation disabled
*   - Timer disabled, waits for Start function to be called
* <br><br>
* A timer counter device may contain multiple timer counters. The symbol
* XTC_DEVICE_TIMER_COUNT defines the number of timer counters in the device.
* The device currently contains 2 timer counters.
* <br><br>
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. It works with
* physical addresses only. Any needs for dynamic memory management, threads
* or thread mutual exclusion, virtual memory, or cache control must be
* satisfied by the layer above this driver.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a ecm  08/16/01 First release
* 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
* 1.10b mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style.
* 1.11a sdm  08/22/08 Removed support for static interrupt handlers from the MDD
*		      file
* 2.00a ktn  10/30/09 Updated to use HAL API's. _m is removed from all the macro
*		      definitions.
* 2.01a ktn  07/12/10 Renamed the macro XTimerCtr_ReadReg as XTmrCtr_ReadReg
*		      for naming consistency (CR 559142).
* 2.02a sdm  09/28/10 Updated the driver tcl to generate the xparameters
*		      for the timer clock frequency (CR 572679).
* 2.03a rvo  11/30/10 Added check to see if interrupt is enabled before further
*		      processing for CR 584557.
* </pre>
