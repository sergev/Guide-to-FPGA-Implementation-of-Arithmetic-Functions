* @file xintc_intr.c
*
* This file contains the interrupt processing for the XIntc component which
* is the driver for the Xilinx Interrupt Controller.  The interrupt
* processing is partitioned seperately such that users are not required to
* use the provided interrupt processing.  This file requires other files of
* the driver to be linked in also.
*
* Two different interrupt handlers are provided for this driver such that the
* user must select the appropriate handler for the application.  The first
* interrupt handler, XIntc_VoidInterruptHandler, is provided for systems
* which use only a single interrupt controller or for systems that cannot
* otherwise provide an argument to the XIntc interrupt handler (e.g., the RTOS
* interrupt vector handler may not provide such a facility).  The constant
* XPAR_INTC_SINGLE_DEVICE_ID must be defined for this handler to be included in
* the driver.  The second interrupt handler, XIntc_InterruptHandler, uses an
* input argument which is an instance pointer to an interrupt controller driver
* such that multiple interrupt controllers can be supported.  This handler
* requires the calling function to pass it the appropriate argument, so another
* level of indirection may be required.
*
* Note that both of these handlers are now only provided for backward
* compatibility. The handler defined in xintc_l.c is the recommended handler.
*
* The interrupt processing may be used by connecting one of the interrupt
* handlers to the interrupt system.  These handlers do not save and restore
* the processor context but only handle the processing of the Interrupt
* Controller.  The two handlers are provided as working examples. The user is
* encouraged to supply their own interrupt handler when performance tuning is
* deemed necessary.

* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00b jhl  02/13/02 First release
* 1.00c rpm  10/17/03 New release. Support the static vector table created
*                     in the xintc_g.c configuration table. Collapse handlers
*                     to use the XIntc_DeviceInterruptHandler() in xintc_l.c.
* 1.00c rpm  04/09/04 Added conditional compilation around the old handler
*                     XIntc_VoidInterruptHandler(). This handler will only be
*                     include/compiled if XPAR_INTC_SINGLE_DEVICE_ID is defined.
* 1.10c mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style
* 2.00a ktn  10/20/09 Updated to use HAL Processor APIs.
*
* </pre>
*
* @internal
*
* This driver assumes that the context of the processor has been saved prior to
* the calling of the Interrupt Controller interrupt handler and then restored
* after the handler returns. This requires either the running RTOS to save the
* state of the machine or that a wrapper be used as the destination of the
* interrupt vector to save the state of the processor and restore the state
* after the interrupt handler returns.
