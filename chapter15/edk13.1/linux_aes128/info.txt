To test the server executable with the PC

1. Open a Linux or Cygwin console and change directory to the executable folder
2. Type the following commands: 
(substitute the X of /dev/com1 by the required PC serial port such as /dev/com3, /dev/ttyUSB0 ...) 
(substitute -k "0123456789abcedf" to the required key as a 16-byte text) 

$ stty -F /dev/com1 115200 cs8 -parenb -cstopb -crtscts -isig
$ exec 9<>/dev/com1			
$ ./aes128 -d -c -k "0123456789abcdef" <&9 &
$ ./aes128 -e -c -k "0123456789abcdef" >&9 

-Configures the serial port com1 with 115200bps, 8-bit character set, no parity, one stop bit 
-Maps file descriptor 9 to the serial com1 
-Decripts (as a background process) the input from the serial port to the console
-Encripts the console input to the serial port
